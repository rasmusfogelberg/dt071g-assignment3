# DT071G Programming in C#.NET

## Assignment 3

In this assignment we are learning about object oriented programming. The aim was to make a guestbook in the console. The user should then be able to Read, Create and Delete posts in the guestbook. If the user tries to create a post both Author and Message must be filled out, otherwise nothing is created.
If the user tries to delete a post he will have to confirm his deletion. If the user enters an invalid input (letters or a post number that doesn't exists), the user will get an error message.
